## About Project
Mesto is an application for publishing photos to a shared feed. This is a training project in which I worked with React.js, HTML/CSS and REST-API. A frontend and backend have been developed for the application. The application was developed taking into account declarative and reactive programming approaches.

The frontend is developed using BEM, in HTML and CSS. Interactive functionality is implemented in Javascript, React.js . The project is connected to the server via the REST API. The build with Webpack is configured.

The backend is developed with node.js, express.js. The application implements request and error handling. The routers are protected by authorization, the password is hashed. Requests are validated before being passed to controllers and in the database schema

Git is used for version control.
